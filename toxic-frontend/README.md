This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Installation

Install the project by running the command

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the project locally by running the command

```bash
npm run dev
```

The project will launch at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) per default.

## Time estimation

- Initial setup of framework: 10 minutes.
- Hook up the API to the framework and create the first fetches: 30-60 minutes.
- Search bar functionality: 1 hour.
- Landing page + styling: 45 minutes.
- TV show detailed page: 30 minutes.
- Testing and polish: 1 hour.
- Documentation: 30 minutes.

## Thought process

- I decided to go for the official API as it will be slightly more of a challenge where I can display my knowledge in how to handle external data and the usage of environment keys.
- I was tempted to use Tailwind but decided to go for module.css instead, to display my knowledge of Next.js as a framework.
